## **Text editing summary**

#### During the reading of text editing there are alot of different types of text editing options that will work best with what system you are working on. microsoft from the reviews and current users Notepad++ is one of the best out there for windows users. Mac has its own special text editors that benefit them in there own ways, for example Brackets and Atom are great options for Mac as they are compatible and able to run very well.
#### There isnt a right or wrong choice for what you choose to be honest its a personal decision and what feels more comfortable for you and what feels right.
#### A nice thing I read is text editors can really help with typos and any possible mistakes you might make with typing long difficult code. Using these text editors can honestly only benefit you in everyway because trying to write code with out some guidance can really be a struggle and the text editors can help find and fix those small mistakes when you can look right past them.
#### Working on the terminal for microsoft was not easy at all it took quite alot of time and one mistake can really hold you up. The nice thing about the terminal is beable to command and edit your files and program from one spot, there are alot of commands and things to wrap the head around but know if you focus and can learn them it will be very easy to manage your computer in the right way.
